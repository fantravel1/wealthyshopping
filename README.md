# WealthyShopping.com — Elite Mega-Site Blueprint (README)
## The Global Index of the Most Expensive Stores on Earth (Mapped + Ranked)

---

# Executive Vision

**WealthyShopping.com** is a global, map-first mega-site that indexes the most expensive stores in the world across every luxury shopping category — ranked by **price reality**, not vibes.

This is not a listicle site.
This is not influencer luxury.
This is not “best shopping streets.”

This is:

> **A luxury retail intelligence platform — mapped globally and ranked by category using real price signals.**

WealthyShopping becomes the world’s most useful reference for:

- ultra-luxury shoppers  
- luxury travel planners  
- stylists and personal shoppers  
- journalists  
- luxury brand researchers  
- students of fashion and consumer culture  
- anyone fascinated by wealth ecosystems

# 1) Core Thesis

Luxury shopping online is fragmented.

Most information is:
- scattered  
- not comparable  
- not price-rigorous  
- overly aesthetic  
- overly affiliate-driven  

WealthyShopping.com solves this by becoming:

## A global, structured luxury store index ranked by Average Price Tag (APT).

---

# 2) The Category

## WealthyShopping.com
### The Bloomberg Terminal of Luxury Retail

WealthyShopping is built like a data product, not a blog.

The platform combines:

- a global interactive map  
- category-by-category rankings  
- city and neighborhood clustering  
- store profile dossiers  
- a pricing index system  
- an update cadence and confidence scoring  

---

# 3) The North Star Metric

## APT — Average Price Tag (in USD)
For every store, WealthyShopping estimates:

- entry ticket (lowest common purchase)
- median ticket (typical purchase)
- icon ticket (most signature product)
- max ticket (upper range / ultra tier)

All normalized into USD.

This becomes the core ranking system.

---

# 6) The Ranking System (How We Make It Real)

WealthyShopping is only legendary if the rankings are credible.

Each store receives a composite profile with 4 layers:

---

## A) APT — Average Price Tag (Core)
Estimated from a sample of item prices.

MVP target:
- 10–25 SKU samples per store/category

Ideal target:
- 25–50 SKU samples per store/category

APT is normalized to USD and used for rankings.

---

## B) UTI — Ultra Tier Index (How High It Goes)
Signals of extreme pricing, such as:
- couture / bespoke availability
- high jewelry salons
- private client collections
- rare complications (watches)
- appointment-only buying
- custom commissions

---

## C) Access & Experience Score (Optional)
Not used as the primary rank, but valuable for users.

Includes:
- appointment required
- private salon availability
- concierge services
- “flagship” experience level

---

## D) Credibility Score (Non-Negotiable)
Every store is assigned a confidence rating based on:

- data sources
- SKU count sampled
- recency of validation
- store transparency

This prevents the platform from becoming speculation.

---

# 7) Store Profile Page (The Core Unit of the Platform)
